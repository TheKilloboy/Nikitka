# üé∞ Casino Nikitka | DODEP Edition

Welcome to Casino Nikitka! This is a fun, browser-based slot machine game where the ultimate goal is to spell the word "–ù–ò–ö–ò–¢–ö–ê" to hit the jackpot.

## üöÄ Purpose

This project is a simple yet engaging web application that simulates a slot machine. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective for the player is to spin the reels and align the letters to form the name "–ù–ò–ö–ò–¢–ö–ê".

## üéÆ How to Play

1.  **Open the Game**: Simply open the `dodep.nikitka.pro` in your favorite web browser.
2.  **Start Spinning**:
    *   Click the large **"üé≤ –ö–†–£–¢–ò–¢–¨"** (Spin) button.
    *   Alternatively, you can press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to spin the reels.
3.  **The Goal**: The objective is to land the correct letters on each of the seven reels to spell out **–ù-–ò-–ö-–ò-–¢-–ö-–ê**.
4.  **Track Your Progress**: The game keeps track of:
    *   **–ü–æ–ø—ã—Ç–æ–∫ (Spins)**: The total number of times you've spun the reels.
    *   **–ü–æ–±–µ–¥ (Wins)**: The number of times you've hit the jackpot.
    *   **–ü—Ä–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç (Percentage)**: Your win rate.

A special "Jackpot" message and a fireworks display will appear when you win!
